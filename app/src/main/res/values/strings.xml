        \u25BA Sensor Used: Magnetometer (Magnetic Field Sensor)\n\n
        \u25BA How it works: Detects changes in Earth\'s magnetic field caused by metal objects. When metal is nearby, it distorts the natural magnetic field, creating detectable variations.\n\n
        \u25BA Simple Mode: Shows deviation from baseline magnetic field. Values above 10 µT indicate potential metal presence. Automatically calibrates to local environment.\n\n
        \u25BA Advanced Mode: Displays raw magnetic field strength (25-65 µT typical). Useful for analyzing magnetic interference and environmental conditions.\n\n
        \u25BA Detection Range: Effective for large metal objects within 5-15cm. Smaller objects like coins detectable within 2-5cm. Range varies by phone model.\n\n
        \u25BA Earth\'s Magnetic Field: Natural strength ranges from 25-65 µTesla depending on location. Stronger at poles, weaker at equator.\n\n
        \u25BA Accuracy Tips: Calibrate away from metal surfaces, move slowly, keep phone flat, avoid electronic interference (WiFi/Bluetooth).\n\n
        \u25BA Safety Note: This is not a professional metal detector. Do not rely on it for safety-critical applications or treasure hunting.\n\n
        \u25BA Fun Fact: Your phone\'s magnetometer is the same technology used in navigation compasses and professional geological surveys!

        \u25BA Sensor Used: Gravity Sensor (Software-based)\n\n
        \u25BA How it works: Uses accelerometer data with filtering to isolate gravitational force from motion. Combines hardware readings with smart algorithms to separate gravity from device movement.\n\n
        \u25BA Earth\'s Gravity: Standard gravity is 9.8 m/s² downward. Actual values vary slightly by location due to altitude, latitude, and local geology.\n\n
        \u25BA Vector Display: Shows gravity components on X, Y, Z axes. The arrow points in the direction gravity is pulling relative to your device orientation.\n\n
        \u25BA Real-time Graph: Tracks gravity changes over time. Useful for analyzing device movement patterns and orientation stability.\n\n
        \u25BA Device Orientation: Automatically detects phone position - horizontal, vertical, facing up/down. Based on which axis has the strongest gravity component.\n\n
        \u25BA Magnitude Calculation: Total gravity = √(X² + Y² + Z²). Should be close to 9.8 m/s² when device is stationary.\n\n
        \u25BA Applications: Used in navigation, gaming, screen rotation, and scientific measurements. Essential for augmented reality and motion sensing.\n\n
        \u25BA Fun Fact: This sensor fusion technology enables your phone to know its orientation in 3D space, powering features from auto-rotate to fitness tracking!

    <string name="bubble_level_details">
        \u25BA Sensors Used: Accelerometer + Magnetometer (Fusion Sensor)\n\n
        \u25BA How it works: Combines accelerometer and magnetometer data to calculate precise device orientation using rotation matrix.\n\n
        \u25BA Pitch (Y-axis): Forward/backward tilt - like tilting your phone toward or away from you. Positive = tilted up, Negative = tilted down.\n\n
        \u25BA Roll (X-axis): Left/right tilt - like rotating your phone clockwise or counterclockwise. Positive = tilted right, Negative = tilted left.\n\n
        \u25BA Level Detection: When both pitch and roll are within tolerance range (±0.5° to ±5°), the bubble turns green and haptic feedback triggers.\n\n
        \u25BA Features: Multiple sensitivity modes, haptic feedback, and real-time bubble physics simulation.\n\n
        \u25BA Professional Use: Perfect for construction, carpentry, picture hanging, and any leveling task requiring precision.\n\n
        \u25BA Fun Fact: Uses the same sensor fusion technology found in professional digital levels costing hundreds of dollars!
